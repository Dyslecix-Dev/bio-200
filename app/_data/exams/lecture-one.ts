    question: "Describe the basics of muscle contraction.",
    answer:
      "Electrical signal from neuron runs down sarcolemma into the t-tumbles and into the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions. Myosin heads chemically attache to actin thin filaments using calcium ions and ATP. Once attached to actin filaments, the myosin heads pivot and pull on the actin fibers, thus bring the Z discs closer to the M line and shortening the sarcomere. This shortens and contracts the entire myofibril and thus contracts the muscle fiber.",
